# **Whispr**, the app that doesn't need your driver's license to work

Whispr is a chat/communications software I make/made because I am fed up with everyone grabbing every bit of data from you. This should NOT be the norm for chat apps, or any applications for that matter.

### Features:
- the app is literally not even in alpha :sob:

### Features W.I.P.
- [ ] A secure connection with the server.
- [ ] A login where personal identification is not neccesary.
- [ ] Server-like chat structure (slight inspiration from discord).
- [ ] DM's.
- [ ] Te option for absolutely NO data collection except for essential account info (e.g. username/password/etc) (NOTE: this will impact user-friendlyness such as no chat history).
- [ ] The ability to launch your own physical servers, and with that a clone of whispr for private use.
- [ ] More coming

And also, all the source code will *never* be generated using Articial Intelligence, and is strictly kept to a minimum for brainstorming.
