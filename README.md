# **Whispr**, the app that doesn't need your driver's license to work

Whispr is a chat/communications software I make/made because I am fed up with everyone grabbing every bit of data from you. This should NOT be the norm for chat apps.

### Features:
- the app is literally not even in alpha :sob:

### Features W.I.P.
- [ ] a secure connection to a server via websocket.
- [ ] a login without personal identification
- [ ] server-like chat structure (slight inspiration from discord)
- [ ] DM's
- [ ] the option for absolutely ZERO data collection except for your account info (e.g. username/password/etc) (NOTE: this will impact user-friendlyness such as no chat history)
- [ ] more coming

And also, I will use AI STRICTLY for brainstorming on how to improve and NEVER in the writing of code or similar tasks.
